        PHYSICAL EXERCISE:\n\nExercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, preventing aging, developing muscles and the cardiovascular system, honing athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improving health and also for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and enhance well-being.\n\nCLASSIFICATION:\n\nPhysical exercises are generally grouped into three types, depending on the overall effect they have on the human body:\n\n
        1. Aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting. The goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular endurance. Examples of aerobic exercise include running, cycling, swimming, brisk walking, skipping rope, rowing, hiking, dancing, playing tennis, continuous training, and long distance running.\n\n2. Anaerobic exercise, which includes strength and resistance training, can firm, strengthen, and increase muscle mass, as well as improve bone density, balance, and coordination.[4] Examples of strength exercises are push-ups, pull-ups, lunges, squats, bench press. Anaerobic exercise also include weight training, functional training, eccentric training, interval training, sprinting, and high-intensity interval training increase short-term muscle strength.\n\n
        3. Flexibility exercises stretch and lengthen muscles. Activities such as stretching help to improve joint flexibility and keep muscles limber. The goal is to improve the range of motion which can reduce the chance of injury.\nPhysical exercise can also include training that focuses on accuracy, agility, power, and speed.\n\n
        TYPES OF EXERCISES:\n\nExercise and physical activity fall into four basic categories—endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility. Most people tend to focus on one activity or type of exercise and think they’re doing enough. Each type is different, though. Doing them all will give you more benefits. Mixing it up also helps to reduce boredom and cut your risk of injury.\n\nENDURANCE:\n\nEndurance, or aerobic, activities increase your breathing and heart rate. They keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system healthy and improve your overall fitness. Building your endurance makes it easier to carry out many of your everyday activities. Endurance exercises include:\n\n1. Brisk walking or jogging\n2. Yard work (mowing, raking, digging)\n3. Dancing\n\n
        STRENGTH:\n\nStrength exercises make your muscles stronger. They may help you stay independent and carry out everyday activities, such as climbing stairs and carrying groceries. These exercises also are called “strength training” or “resistance training.” Strength exercises include:\n\n1. Lifting weights\n2. Using a resistance band\n3. Using your own body weight\n\n
        BALANCE:\n\nBalance exercises help prevent falls, a common problem in older adults. Many lower-body strength exercises will also improve your balance. Balance exercises include:\n\n1. Standing on one foot\n2. Heel-to-toe walk\n3. Tai Chi\n\n
        FLEXIBILITY:\n\nFlexibility exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limber. Being flexible gives you more freedom of movement for other exercises as well as for your everyday activities, including driving and getting dressed. Flexibility exercises include:\n\n1. Shoulder and Upper Arm stretch\n2. Calf stretch\n3. Yoga\n\n

        HEALTH:\n\nHealth is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in which disease and infirmity are absent.\n\n
        HISTORY:\n\nThe meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body ability to function, health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease. An example of such a definition of health is:\n a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity, ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles, ability to deal with physical, biological, psychological, and social stress.\n Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to well-being, in terms of physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity. Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model.\n\n
        DETERMINANTS:\n\nGenerally, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance for both his health status and quality of their life It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of health science, but also through the efforts and intelligent lifestyle choices of the individual and society. According to the World Health Organization, the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment, the physical environment and the persons individual characteristics and behaviors.
        \nMore specifically, key factors that have been found to influence whether people are healthy or unhealthy include the following:\n\n
        1. Income and social status\n
2. Social support networks\n
3. Education and literacy\n
4. Employment,working conditions\n
5. Social environments\n
6. Physical environments\n
        7. Biology and genetics\n
        8. Gender\n\nPOTENTIAL ISSUES:\n\n
        A number of types of health issues are common around the globe. Disease is one of the most common. According to GlobalIssues.org, approximately 36 million people die each year from non-communicable (not contagious) disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease.
        \nAmong communicable diseases, both viral and bacterial, AIDS/HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are the most common, causing millions of deaths every year.
        \nAnother health issue that causes death or contributes to other health problems is malnutrition, especially among children. One of the groups malnutrition affects most is young children. Approximately 7.5 million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition, usually brought on by not having the money to find or make food.
        \nBodily injuries are also a common health issue worldwide. These injuries, including broken bones, fractures, and burns can reduce a persons quality of life or can cause fatalities including infections that resulted from the injury or the severity injury in general.\n\n
        MAINTAINING:\n\n
        DIET-\n\n
        An important way to maintain your personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. blood pressure). Water is essential for growth, reproduction and good health. Macronutrients are consumed in relatively large quantities and include proteins, carbohydrates, and fats and fatty acids. Micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – are consumed in relatively smaller quantities, but are essential to body processes.[40] The food guide pyramid is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e. Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, and Sugars). Making healthy food choices is important because it can lower your risk of heart disease, developing some types of cancer, and it will contribute to maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n
        EXERCISE-\n\n
        Physical exercise enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It strengthens muscles and improves the cardiovascular system. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are four types of exercise: endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance.\n\n
        SLEEP-\n\n
        Sleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness.[44] In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night.[45] Due to the role of sleep in regulating metabolism, insufficient sleep may also play a role in weight gain or, conversely, in impeding weight loss.[46] Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the World Health Organization, declared that "shiftwork that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans," speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep.[47] In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age and concluded that "Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being."\n\n
